# Project: Data Scientist Capstone (Regression to predict Machinery's time to next failure)

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - PyCaret

 
No additional installations beyond the Google Colab distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
This data set contains information about 2,852 maintenances done on forestry machinery from January 2020 to August 2021. The main goal is to test as much regression models as possible in order to predict the next time a machine will failure and need maintenance. Nowadays this kind of failure it is not predicted anyway and causes productivity loss since the machine fails unexpectedly.

The project involved:
So in order to achieve this result we will do a Data Wrangling to check and fix problems in data, like duplicates, naming translations, fix nulls, creating new relevant fields. After that we will do a Exploratory Data Analysis in the dataset to better understand the data and shape it in order to use it in the upcoming model testing. After the EDA we will do the Modeling part where with the help of PyCaret module we will test several regression models in order to check if regression can be used to predict next time a machine will failure. In the end of the notebook there is conclusions, recommendations and references.

## File Descriptions
There is a source file (xlsx) and notebook (IPYNB) which contains DATA GATHERING, CLEANING, EDA, MODELING, CONCLUSIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS.
